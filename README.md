What is a Kata?

In our dojo, kata are code challenges focused on improving skill and technique. Some train programming fundamentals, while others focus on complex problem solving. Others are puzzles meant to test your creative problem solving, while others are based on real world coding scenarios.

Each kata is crafted for and by the community. The author (or Sensei) who created kata will initially include one or more languages to train in. Other Code Warriors later can "translate" the kata into additional languages.

About Codewars


Codewars is a community of developers, who are called Code Warriors (or just warriors), that train on improving their development skills. Think of it like a coding dojo - where developers train with each other and help each other get better through practice.
Why Codewars?
Learning from Others

Every time you complete a challenge (which we call "kata") you will be shown the solutions that others came up with. Until you try it yourself, you really won't know how great of a feeling it is to complete a kata thinking you nailed it and then see how others did it, or how many different types of approaches are possible. It is an amazing way to learn and adapt new techniques.
